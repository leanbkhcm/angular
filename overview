download angular, out it and create global.js in folder Scripts

declare angular.js, global.js in config bundle

declare ng-app in div in _layout.cshtml,
ex: <div ng-app="myapp">	@renderbody()	</div>

declare ng-app in global in globar js file

declare ng-controller in home.cshtml and home.js
ex: app.controller("myapp", function($scope, $http)
{
	$http.get("controller/actionName")
	.then(function(res)
	{
		$scope.Student = res.data
		res.data can be seen from debug
	}
	)
}
)


homecontroller has method index(), just return view
home.cshtml first just render html. at the end of file, 
call 
@section scripts {
	@scripts.Render("~/Views/Home/Home.js")
}

section to call home.js
home.js will call api/function (return json) to get data
home.js is just angular syntax. 
ex: return $scope.Student = res.data
res.data can be seen from debug

home.cshtml will be continued by using Studen gotten from home.js
